Start by doing the header and side bar with its style doing it with js. FIRST do all the necessary front end components and style them ->
	header DONE

	sidebar TO-DO ->- quatris already created, have to STYLE THEM and DISPLAY USER SUBJECTS/SUBJECT DROPDOWN TO PICK also to get each subject the FIB offers (hard coded maybe)
					- make it return the quatri object + the div for the DOM, and use the object in the future
					- create subject class and maybe even task class, store each quatri in the index and each subject to the quatri and each task to the subject
					(task -> subject -> quatri -> index)
					- everything above still to do + task class done inside subject class
					
	maincontent TO-DO
	
	RESTRUCTURE OF THE CODE -> index should be more clear.
	
CHECK SOME FONTS + STYLE in general

After finishing most of the functionality -> styling



slow progress ... ...


create task section and implementation
hardcode all subjects and quatris
style task sections
check edge cases
re-structure the whole code (it's really messy)
